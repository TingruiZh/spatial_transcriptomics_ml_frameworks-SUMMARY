# üß¨ ML Frameworks in Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis Methods

This repository summarizes recent machine learning (ML) frameworks applied in **spatial transcriptomics** data analysis. These methods focus on discovering spatial domains, cell types, and embedding representations from high-dimensional single-cell gene expression data.

## üöÄ Key ML Frameworks

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
- **Use case**: Modeling gene expression dependencies between neighboring spots or cells.
- **Example**: 
  - **UTAG**: Combines graph smoothing with clustering.
  - **BANKSY**: Uses azimuthal Gabor filters to project gene expression into an embedding space.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- **Use case**: Learning low-dimensional embeddings that preserve both feature and graph structure.
- **Example**: 
  - **VGAE**: Graph-based VAE (lacks explicit feature reconstruction loss).
  - **BASS**: Incorporates feature reconstruction likelihood directly.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Topic Models
- **Use case**: Modeling spatial domains and cell types jointly.
- **Example**: 
  - **SpatialTopic**: Fast and interpretable; uses collapsed Gibbs sampling.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)
- **Use case**: Clustering nodes (spots/cells) by accounting for feature variance across dimensions.
- **Example**:
  - Used in **BASS** to improve clustering performance over KMeans.

## üìä Data Benchmarks

- Annotated **MERFISH mouse hypothalamus** data.
- Simulated data sets.
- **10x Genomics Xenium** breast tissue.
- **NanoString CosMx** NSCLC tissue.

## üî• Notable Trends

- Models increasingly integrate **spatial information** and **gene expression**.
- Combining **generative models** with **probabilistic clustering** (e.g., GMM) enhances interpretability.
- Growing focus on benchmarking across **real** and **simulated** datasets.
